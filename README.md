# Go notes 📝

This repository contains my notes, examples and playgrounds illustrating the syntax, functionalities and peculiarities of the Go language.

Many of these examples were inspired by [a fantastic tutorial by Michael van Sickle on the FreeCodeCamp YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YS4e4q9oBaU). This is not just a copy of the examples he showed, but rather an extension and interpretation of the same, including more elaborate examples that I created while digging deeper into certain features of the Go language, as well as many notes of my own to use as a quick reference whenever I am working in a Go project.

I am publishing these notes here in hope that they can be helpful to someone picking up Go in the future, someone going through the same tutorial, or just for reference on how to use some of the features that make Go such a cool language to use. 😎
